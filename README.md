# CodeAlpha_A-B_Testing

The A/B testing project in the notebook follows a structured process, summarized as:

1. **Data Simulation**: Synthetic data was generated, including unique IDs and two features, simulating a real-world scenario with different variables.

2. **Sampling**: A subset of this synthetic population was randomly selected to create a sample used for the A/B test.

3. **Group Assignment**: The sample was split into two groups: treatment (A) and control (B), assigned randomly.

4. **Visual Analysis**: Visualizations (KDE plots) were used to compare the distributions of the features between the treatment and control groups to ensure similar distribution, validating the random assignment.

5. **Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical tests (t-tests) were conducted to determine if significant differences existed between the treatment and control groups for each feature, identifying whether observed differences were statistically significant.

6. **Conclusion**: The hypothesis tests' results indicate whether the treatment had a significant effect compared to the control.
